# Sola Fide

A mod for Europa Universalis IV that builds on the mechanics and content of the Reformation, whithout drastically altering gameplay or the map.

## Design principles

- Mostly maintain the same "zoom level" as the base game, both in terms of the map as well as the level of simulation
- Enrich the religion mechanics of the game, with a particular focus on making the Reformation less binary and straightforward
- Be a little more honest about some of the particular cruelties of the period (antisemitism; slavery; the list is long) rather than handwave them away as "too detailed"
- Focus on working within the 1444 start and the vanilla map

## Specific feature wishlist

1. Add more interesting mechanics around the "Reformation Desire" counter, rather than it just mostly monotonically increasing.
2. Make playing as the Papal States more interesting, by giving the tag more to do in terms of supporting Catholic countries in supressing heresies and staving off the reformation.
3. Better represent the Bohemian Reformation, and pre-Luther reform attempts by eg Lollards, Waldensians, Savanarola, etc.
4. Add more detail to the Reformation itself, by representing more than just the Lutheran and Calvinist waves, eg:
  * Anabaptists and the Radical Reformation
  * A more fraught English Reformation, including detail in the English Civil War and the Dissenters
  * Add events around the English Reformation that represent the Catholic/Protestant push and pull, and the Elizibethan Settlement
5. Add some juicy ahistorical possibilities for both Catholics and Protestants, to keep things from feeling too "on rails" gameplay-wise.
6. In general, add the feeling that religious minorities persist even after all provinces are converted.
7. Do all of this without adding new gameplay mechanics or messing with the map. Maaaaybe extend the timeline back to 1434 and forward to 1849.
