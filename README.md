# Sola Fide

A mod for Europa Universalis IV that builds on the mechanics and content of the Reformation, whithout drastically altering gameplay or the map.

## Goals

1. Add more interesting mechanics around the "Reformation Desire" counter, rather than it just mostly monotonically increasing.
2. Make playing as the Papal States more interesting, by giving the tag more to do in terms of supporting Catholic countries in supressing heresies and staving off the reformation.
3. Better represent the Bohemian Reformation, and pre-Luther reform attempts by eg Lollards, Waldensians, Savanarola, etc.
4. Add more detail to the Reformation itself, by representing more than just the Lutheran and Calvinist waves, eg:
  * Anabaptists and the Radical Reformation
  * A more fraught English Reformation, including detail in the English Civil War and the Dissenters
  * Add events around the English Reformation that represent the Catholic/Protestant push and pull, and the Elizibethan Settlement
5. Add some juicy ahistorical possibilities for both Catholics and Protestants, to keep things from feeling too "on rails" gameplay-wise.
6. In general, add the feeling that religious minorities persist even after all provinces are converted.
7. Do all of this without adding new gameplay mechanics or messing with the map. Maaaaybe extend the timeline back to 1434 and forward to 1849.

## Event chains

### Vaudois Crusade and the Piedmont Easter (Waldensian)

At the start of the game, only one province is Waldensian (which even then is a stretch). The Papal State has the option to proscute the Vaudois Crusade against them, at the cost of destabalizing Savoy.

Savoy, if it chooses to, can end the crusade by negotiating a settlement, or it can help the Pope prosecute it.

If Savoy loses, and things get out of hand, they might flip Waldensian; the more likely course of action is that the province is converted and the Waldensians only appear as occasional event troops (still making it possible they could convert provinces later).

### The Legacy of Jan Hus (Hussite/Utraquist/Taborites)

The Hussite Wars ended in 1434, and the Utraquists have been allowed to practice their communion rite, for now. But the Papal State still has its eyes on restoring the official rite and exercising dominance over the church in Bohemia and Moravia. Meanwhile, the Taborites, who feel betrayed by their Utraquist countrymen, are biding their time until the right moment to revolt presents itself.

Can the followers of Jan Hus keep their movement alive, when besite on all sides by their enemies?

### The Dissenters & the English Civil War (Puritains etc.)

The Henrican Reformation did not go far enough for many, but when Edward championed the Protestant cause as the successor to Henry, the debate about what form the English Church should take, and how tolerant it should be, flared into open violence on many occasions.

To complicate matters, Queen Mary attempted to roll back the entire Anglican movement in one fell stroke.

Can you guide England and Britain through the chaos of civil war, and help forge the identity of the Anglican church? Or will you rejoin the Pope to help supress the Dissenters who would completely revolutionize society?

### The Radical Reformation (Anabaptist)

While the debate over the Reformation rages, a small group of pious people belive that not only is the church held captive by secular princes, but the time for establishing society in the image preached by Jesus is not at some point in the future, but here and now.

The Radical Reformation is unlike any other movement in Europe at this time: they seek not just to repudiate the power of the Pope, but to revolutionize society itself. Hated by Protestant and Catholic alike, the zealous and soemtimes violent Anabaptists seek to establish the kingdom of God on Earth.
