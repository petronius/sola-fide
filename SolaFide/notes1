"The Zwickau Prophets"

On December 27, 1521, three "prophets" appeared in Wittenberg from Zwickau who were influenced by (and, in turn, influencing) Thomas Müntzer—Thomas Dreschel, Nicholas Storch, and Mark Thomas Stübner. They preached an apocalyptic, radical alternative to Lutheranism. Their preaching helped to stir the feelings concerning the social crisis which erupted in the German Peasants' War in southern Germany in 1525 as a revolt against feudal oppression. Under the leadership of Müntzer, it became a war against all constituted authorities and an attempt to establish by revolution an ideal Christian commonwealth, with absolute equality among persons and the community of goods.

England

(also need to make enlgish civil war more likely)

"Dissenters Arise!"

- Country is Anglican or Protestant
- "English Civil War" or "Civil War" is active

The Dissenters object to state interference in religion. Many feel that our state religion does not go far enough toward's Christ's true teachings.

* "We must respect their beliefs" - Province becomes a Dissenter religion, chance of center of reformation for this religion
* "Stamp out this heresy!" - Province becomes a Dissenter religion, no center of reformation, -1 stab
