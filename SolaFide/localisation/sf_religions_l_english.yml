 waldensian_religion_desc:0 "Originally known as the Poor of Lyon in the late twelfth century, the founding of the Waldensians is attributed to Peter Waldo, a wealthy merchant who gave away his property around 1173 and preaching apostolic poverty as the way to perfection.\nBy 1215 the Waldensians were declared heretical, not because they preached apostolic poverty, but because they were not willing to recognize the prerogatives of local bishops over the content of their preaching, nor to recognize standards about who was fit to preach. Pope Innocent III offered the Waldensians the chance to return to the Church, and many did, taking the name 'Poor Catholics'. Many did not, and were subjected to intense persecution and were confronted with organised and general discrimination in the following centuries."
