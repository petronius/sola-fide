# Playable minimum

Focussing on the 1444 start

- ~~Add Waldensian~~

- Add regligious minority mechanic
	- Provinces can have a "religious minority" mechanic of any active religion (+x% unrest; +x% min local autonomy)
	- If unrest in the province is higher than X%, religious zealots of the minority religion can spawn
	- Minorities in a province can be persecuted, increasing unrest but giving a monthly chance to eliminate them
	- If a province is being converted there is a low % chance that "X religion entrenched" will be applied (+x% culture conversion cost; +x% reglious conversion resistance)
		- When conversion finishes, "X religion entrenched" is removed, and a relgious minority modifier is added

- Add Jewish minority provinces
- Add Baltic Pagain minority provinces
